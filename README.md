DA Final Project

The main objective of inventory management system is to predict the need of stocks of a particular item such that item should not be out of stock  or over stock at any given point of time. So that the company need not invest excuess amount or the coustmer need not to leave the platfrom due to reason that product is out of stock .So that the business can move in a smooth way.There are models like arima and lstm to analyse the time series data and predecting the values.

There are two major approaches for predicting and analysing the time series data (i)ARIMA ,(ii)LSTM .ARIMA is a form of regression analysis that indicates the strength of a dependent variable relative to other changing variables. The final objective of the model is to predict future time series movement by examining the differences between values in the series instead of through actual values.LSTM assumes that there are input values (time series) which are to be used to predict an output value. Since the time series data only had an input series, the stock price value from time t-1 was used as input for predicting the stock price value from time t as the output.
